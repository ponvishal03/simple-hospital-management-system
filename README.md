# simple-hospital-management-system

The Hospital Management System (HMS) is a Python-based desktop application developed to modernize the administrative workflow in healthcare facilities. It enables hospitals and clinics to efficiently manage patient records, prescriptions, appointments, and generate reports ‚Äî all from a user-friendly graphical interface.
